        <br>
        <p>
            <b>JobNest</b> is designed to connect job seekers and employers efficiently. Job seekers can explore a variety of job openings, 
            filtered by category, location, job type (full-time, part-time, remote), and more. Employers can post job listings, providing detailed descriptions of roles, responsibilities, and requirements.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The platformâ€™s <b>frontend</b> is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to offer a user-friendly interface, while the <B>backend</B>, powered by Node.js, manages essential functionalities like user authentication, 
            job posting, and advanced filtering options. <b>MongoDB</b> serves as the database, securely storing job listings, user profiles, and application details.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            A key feature of the platform is its <B>job recommendation engine</B>, powered by Python. It analyzes user behavior, search history, and preferences to 
            suggest tailored job opportunities. Job seekers receive notifications when new, matching jobs are posted, helping them stay updated on relevant opportunities. 
            Additionally, the platform includes an <B>admin dashboard</B> for employers and administrators to manage job listings efficiently. With a robust tech stack and 
            advanced features like recommendation systems and real-time notifications, this platform is designed to enhance the job search experience for both seekers and employers.
